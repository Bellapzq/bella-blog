            <p>
              Hi everyone, I‚Äôm Bella! I‚Äôm from Guangdong, China, and now living in Sydney.
              I love traveling and cooking. I graduated from UNSW in December 2024.
              While looking for a software engineering job, I started this little blog to record my travel guides and recipes.
            </p>
            <p>
              This blog has two main parts: travel and cooking.
              <br />‚ú® In the travel section, my guides will cover transport, food, tickets, accommodation, and attractions. I‚Äôll also share tips on how to explore China as a foreigner. (Oh, and don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthis blog is ad-free!)
              <br />‚ú® In the cooking section, I‚Äôll sort recipes by difficulty level and try my best to keep the ingredient list short. Most of my shopping is done at Aussie supermarkets, and I‚Äôll walk you step-by-step from shopping basket to dinner table so you can enjoy authentic dishes without the stress.
            </p>

            <p>
              Right now, I‚Äôm exploring the world with my Dutch partner. Since he‚Äôs allergic to peanuts, walnuts, and hazelnuts, we‚Äôve also learned how to carefully avoid those along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Back in 2022, I casually started sharing my travel guides on Xiaohongshu, and to my surprise, they gained a lot of love and even helped many people. If you‚Äôd like to see more, my Xiaohongshu ID is <b>499200432</b>. I really enjoy the process of making guides and sharing them, so feel free to follow me there or leave me a message!
            </p>
            <p>
              I noticed that travel guides about China are still quite rare online, so I decided to bring my Xiaohongshu posts over to this personal blog, adding extra tips for international travelers. Since many Chinese restaurants don‚Äôt list ingredients or allergens, I‚Äôll also highlight whenever I spot peanuts, walnuts, or hazelnuts in dishes.

            <p>
              I‚Äôve been interested in cooking since primary school. My family always encouraged me and taught me quick and simple Cantonese dishes. I hope I can also help you cook traditional Cantonese food that‚Äôs light on seasoning but still super delicious!
            </p>
            <p>
              While traveling, I love trying new foods and then recreating them at home. One summer in uni, I challenged myself to cook something different every day for two months. That experience really expanded my food map from Cantonese dishes to all kinds of Chinese cuisine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later on, I met my partner, a Dutch foodie who also loves to cook. From him, I learned recipes from other countries, and now my recipe map has happily expanded to the whole world.

              His name is Floris, and he‚Äôs from the Netherlands. In 2023, he came to UNSW as an exchange student, and that‚Äôs how we met. I often wonder, how could there be a soul so perfectly in tune with mine? We‚Äôre in sync so many times it feels magical.
            </p>
            <p>
              At first, we were just really good friends‚Äîexploring Sydney together and hunting for delicious food. Over time, we fell deeply in love, becoming life partners as well as travel buddies on our adventures. He‚Äôs also my very best friend in this world. Even though he now lives on the other side of the globe, I love him just as much and always look forward to every trip we share. üíï

              Floris is also an amazing photographer! He‚Äôs captured so many beautiful moments from our travels and foodie adventures, and I‚Äôm grateful to have his stunning photos brighten up this blog. üì∏‚ú®
